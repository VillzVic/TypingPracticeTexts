Nobel Prize

The Nobel Prize (Swedish: Nobelpriset) is a Sweden-based international monetary prize. The award was established in 1895 by the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite Alfred Bernhard Nobel. It was first awarded in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace in 1901. An associated prize, The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was instituted by Sweden's central bank in 1968 and first awarded in 1969. The Nobel Prizes in the specific disciplines (physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature) and the Prize in Economics, which is commonly identified with them, are widely regarded as the most prestigious award one can receive in those fields.

A recipient of the Nobel Prize, a laureate, earns a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation and a sum of money. The amount of money awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year. In 2009 the amount was 10 million SEK per prize. If a prize is awarded jointly to two or more laureates the money is split among them. If two laureates are named, the money is split in half. If three laureates are named, the money is either split equally into thirds, or into a half and two quarters..

The prizes are awarded by different associations. The Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences are awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine by the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet and the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy. Unlike the other prizes, the Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by a Swedish organisation, but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

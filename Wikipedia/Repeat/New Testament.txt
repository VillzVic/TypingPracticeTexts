New Testament

The New Testament (Greek: Kaine Diatheke) is the name given to the second major division of the Christian Bible, the first such division being the much longer Old Testament, both terms being associated with Supersessionism. The New Testament is sometimes called the Greek New Testament or Greek Scriptures, or the New Covenant or the New Law.

The original texts were written by various authors sometime after c. A.D. 45, most likely in Koine Greek (according to Greek primacy), the lingua franca of the eastern part of the Roman Empire. Rylands Library Papyrus P52 is generally accepted as the earliest extant record of a canonical New Testament text, which dates somewhere between 117 A.D. and 138 A.D..

Its books were gradually collected into a single volume. Although Christian denominations differ as to which works are included in the New Testament, and on the issue of the Antilegomena, the majority have settled on the same twenty-seven book canon: it consists of the four narratives of the life and death of Jesus, called "gospels"; a narrative of the Apostles' ministries in the early church, probably by the same author as the Gospel of Luke, which it continues; twenty-one early letters, commonly called "epistles" in biblical context, written by various authors and consisting mostly of Christian counsel and instruction; and an Apocalyptic prophecy.

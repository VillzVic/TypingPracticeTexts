Moveable feast

In Christianity, a moveable feast or movable feast is a holy day -- a feast day or a fast day -- whose date is not fixed to a particular day of the calendar year but moves in response to the date of Easter, the date of which varies according to a complex formula. Easter is itself a "moveable feast".

In addition, in the Anglican Christian tradition, Boxing Day, the first working day after Christmas, is also a moveable feast, it is normally the 26th of December (which is also St Stephen's Day), but if Christmas Day falls on a Saturday then Boxing Day is the following Monday.

By extension, other religions' feasts are occasionally described by the same term. In addition many countries have secular holidays that are moveable, for instance to make holidays more consecutive; the term "moveable feast" is not used in this case however.

By metaphoric extension, a movable feast was used by Ernest Hemingway to mean the memory of a splendid place that continues to go with the moving traveler for the rest of life, after he has had the experience of it and gone away. The author used the term A Moveable Feast for the title of his late-life memoirs of his early life as a stuggling writer in Paris, in the 1920s. He said to a friend: "If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast."

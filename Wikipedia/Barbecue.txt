Barbecue

Barbecue or barbeque (common spelling variant) (with abbreviations BBQ, Bar-B-Q and diminutive form used in Canada; Barbie, used chiefly in Australia and New Zealand ; and called Braai in South Africa) is a method and apparatus for cooking meat with the heat and hot smoke of a fire, smoking wood, or hot coals of charcoal, cooking gas or even electricity; and may include application of a marinade, spice rub or basting sauce to the meat or vegetables.

The term as a noun can refer to the meat, the cooking apparatus itself (the "barbecue ") or to a party that includes such food. The term as an adjective can refer to foods cooked by this method. The term is also used as a verb for the act of cooking food in this manner.

Barbecue is usually done in an outdoor environment by cooking and smoking the meat over wood or charcoal. Restaurant barbecue may be cooked in large brick or metal ovens specially designed for that purpose.

Barbecue has numerous regional variations in many parts of the world.

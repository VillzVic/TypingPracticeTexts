Chateau de Chambord

The royal Chateau de Chambord at Chambord, Loir-et-Cher, France is one of the most recognizable chateaux in the world because of its very distinct French Renaissance architecture that blends traditional French medieval forms with classical Italian structures.

The building, which was never completed, was constructed by King Francois I in part to be near to his mistress the Comtesse de Thoury, Claude Rohan, wife of Julien de Clermont, a member of a very important family of France, whose domaine, the chateau de Muides, was adjacent. Her arms figure in the carved decor of the chateau.

Chambord is the largest chateau in the Loire Valley; it was built to serve as a hunting lodge for Francois I, who maintained his royal residences at Chateau de Blois and Chateau d'Amboise. The original design of the Chateau de Chambord is attributed, though with several doubts, to Domenico da Cortona. Some authors claim that the French Renaissance architect Philibert Delorme had a considerable role in the chateau's design, and others have suggested that Leonardo da Vinci may have designed it.

Chambord was altered considerably during the twenty years of its construction, (1519-1547), during which it was overseen on-site by Pierre Nepveu. With the chateau nearing completion, Francois showed off his enormous symbol of wealth and power by hosting his old archnemesis, Emperor Charles V at Chambord.

Romanichal

The Romanichals (also Romnichals) are a sub-group of the Romani people, and are termed as an ethnic group in the United Kingdom who either live in the United Kingdom, particularly England, Lowland Scotland and Wales. The romanichal diasporia emigrated from the UK, to other parts of the English-speaking world. There are now more people of Romanichal descent in the United States than Britain. They are also found in smaller numbers in South Africa, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

The word "Romanichal" is derived from Romani chal, where chal is Angloromani for "fellow".

Romanichals are thought to have arrived in Britain in the 16th century and - like all Romani - originated in northern India. They are closely related to the Welsh Kale and Romani groups in continental Europe. By contrast, Scottish Travellers is a generic term that includes people of Romanichal descent (especially those at Kirk Yetholm), along with other travelling peoples, including other Romani.

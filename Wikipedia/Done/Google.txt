Google's mission is "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful". The unofficial company slogan, coined by former employee and Gmail's first engineer Paul Buchheit, is "Don't be evil". Google has been criticized for concerns relating to the privacy of personal information, copyright, as well as censorship.

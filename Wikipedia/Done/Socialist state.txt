Socialist state

The term socialist republic (or socialist state, or workers' state) can carry one of several different (but related) meanings.

The term socialist republic is used by those socialists who wish to emphasize that they favour a republican form of government. Furthermore, since many forms of socialism purport to represent the interests of the working class, many socialists refer to a state organized according to their principles as a workers' state. Other socialists, such as anarcho-socialists and some libertarian socialists reject the concept of a socialist state altogether, believing a state is not required to establish a socialist system.

The meanings of the terms 'socialist republic', 'socialist state' and 'workers' state' tend to vary according to the adherents of variants of Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, and non-Communist socialist theories. Most of these theories (but not all) require at least the "commanding heights" of the economy to be nationalised, usually operated according to a plan of production, so that capitalism and the procurement of wage labor for private profit is abolished at least in the major productive and social spheres, although there are some socialist economic theories promoting varying levels of market relations, in combination with public ownership and/or worker cooperatives.

Most theories assume widespread democracy, and some assume workers' democratic participation at every level of economic and state administration, while varying in the degree to which economic planning decisions are delegated to public officials and administrative specialists. States where democracy is lacking yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state are termed by orthodox Trotskyist theories "workers' states" but not socialist states using the terms "degenerated" or "deformed" workers' states.

Some commentators use the term "socialist state" to describe states which provide welfare provisions, such as healthcare and unemployment benefits, despite the economic basis of the state being privatized and clearly capitalist.

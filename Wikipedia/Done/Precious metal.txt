Precious metal

A precious metal is a rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical element of high economic value; this normally excludes natural polonium, radium, actinium and protactinium, which are radioactive and require special handling. Chemically, the precious metals are less reactive than most elements, have high lustre, are softer or more ductile, and have higher melting points than other metals. Historically, precious metals were important as currency, but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code.

The best-known precious metals are the coinage metals gold and silver. While both have industrial uses, they are better known for their uses in art, jewellery and coinage. Other precious metals include the platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.

The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but also by their role as investments and a store of value. Historically, precious metals have commanded much higher prices than common industrial metals. In November 2010, gold reached a price of over $1400.00/troy ounce and silver was about $25.00/troy ounce, compared to copper at $0.11/troy ounce and nickel at $0.36/troy ounce.

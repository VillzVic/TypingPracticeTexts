Steppe

A steppe in physical geography refers to a biome region characterised by grassland plain without trees apart from those near rivers and lakes. The prairie (especially the shortgrass prairie) can be considered a steppe. It may be semi-desert, or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also used to denote the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest, but not dry enough to be a desert.

Steppe are characterized by a continental and semi-arid climate. Peaks can be recorded in the summer of up to 40 C (104 F) and in winter -40 C (-40 F). Besides this huge difference between summer and winter, the differences between day and night are also very great. In the highlands of Mongolia, 30 C (86 F) can be reached during the day with sub-zero C (sub 32 F) readings at night.

Also, the mid-latitude steppes can be summarized by hot summers and cold winters, averaging 250-500 mm (10-20 inches) of rain or equivalent in snowfall per year.

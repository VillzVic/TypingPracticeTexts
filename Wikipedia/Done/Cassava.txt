Cassava

Cassava (Manihot esculenta), also called yuca or manioc, is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae (spurge family) native to South America that is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates. The flour made of the roots is called tapioca.

Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world. Cassava is classified as "sweet" or "bitter" depending on the level of toxic cyanogenic glucosides; improper preparation of bitter cassava causes a disease called konzo. Nevertheless, farmers often prefer the bitter varieties because they deter pests, animals, and thieves.

The name "cassava" is sometimes spelled cassaba or cassada. In English language publications, the plant may be occasionally called by local names, such as mandioca, aipim, or macaxeira (Brazil), kassav (Haiti), mandi'o (Paraguay), akpu or ugburu (Nigeria), bankye (Ghana), mogo or mihogo (Swahili-speaking Africa), kappa or simal tarul (India), maniok (Sri Lanka), singkong (Indonesia), ubi kayu (Malaysia), kamoteng kahoy or balanghoy (Philippines), mushu (China), man sampalang (Thailand), cu san or khoai mi (Vietnam), and manioke, tapioka or manioka (Polynesia).

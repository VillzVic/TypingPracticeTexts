Maramures

Maramures (in Romanian; Hungarian: Maramaros; Latin: Marmatia; Ukrainian: Marmaroshchyna, Maramorshchyna, Maramuresh; Yiddish: (maramurush)) is a geographical, historical and ethno-cultural region in northern Transylvania, along the upper Tisza River; it covers the Maramures Depression and the surrounding mountains that form part of the northeastern Carpathians.

The territory in its southern section is now part of Maramures County in northern Romania; its northern section is part of Zakarpattia Oblast of western Ukraine.

Alternatively, the name Maramures is used for the Maramures County of Romania, which contains the southern section of the former historical region and also small parts of the interbellic Satu Mare County and Salaj County (former pre-World War I Szatmar and Szolnok-Doboka comitata).

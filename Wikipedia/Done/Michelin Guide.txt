Michelin Guide

The Michelin Guide (French: Guide Michelin) is a series of annual guide books published by Michelin for over a dozen countries. The term normally refers to the Michelin Red Guide, the oldest and best-known European hotel and restaurant guide, which awards the Michelin stars. Michelin also publishes Green Guides for travel and tourism, as well as several newer publications such as the Guide Voyageur Pratique (independent travel), Guide Gourmand (good-value eating-places), Guide Escapade (quick breaks) and Guide Coup de Coeur (favourite hotels).

The Michelin Guide has been around since the early 1900s and started as a car and road trip guide. Andre and Edouard Michelin wanted to create a guide to the best restaurants and accommodations available along the travel route of motorists. The guide quickly became incredibly popular for its restaurant information as it highlighted the most exceptional chefs and eateries. It is now the oldest such publication and is now considered the most well-known and influential guide in the culinary world. Many anxiously await its yearly publication, whether culinary aficionados or industry insiders.

The Michelin Guide reviews and rates top restaurants and world chefs with a ratings system of one to three stars with the highest rated being three star chefs and restaurants. Many chefs strive to be listed as a Michelin three star chef as this gives them a high amount of exposure. A three star chef can experience a high level of fame and wealth that may not have been likely without the acknowledgement of the Michelin guide. Many star chefs strive to stay a Michelin star chef as they could lose business and their public name if they go on to lose stars. The Michelin star rating is the most recognized rating system in the culinary world for all of Western Europe.

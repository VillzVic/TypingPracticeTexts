Basque Country (greater region)

The Basque Country as a greater region (Basque: Euskal Herria) is a European cultural region in the western Pyrenees that spans the border between France and Spain, on the Atlantic coast.

It comprises the Spanish Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country and Navarre, and then the Northern Basque Country in France. Over the centuries, elements from both Spanish and French culture (including the respective languages) have been a major influence in the respective parts of the region's culture.

Even though they are not necessarily synonyms, the concept of a single culturally Basque area spanning various regions and countries has been closely associated since its very inception to the politics of Basque nationalism. As such, the region is considered the homeland of the Basque people (Basque: Euskaldunak), their language (Basque: Euskara), culture, and traditions. The perceived association of this concept to Basque nationalism has led to significant sectors of the concerned public opinion denying it any factuality, stressing their own regional identities or singularities instead or the fact that Basque has not been historically spoken in large portions of the claimed territory. This phenomenon is particularly strong in Navarre, where a regional party, Union del Pueblo Navarro has gained consecutive absolute majorities in the Navarrese regional parliament since 1996 campaigning for a separate Navarrese identity as opposed to the one covered in this article, which is regarded as a vehicle of Basque nationalism.

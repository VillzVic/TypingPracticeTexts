Edwin Hubble

Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 - September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer who profoundly changed our understanding of the universe by demonstrating the existence of galaxies other than our own, the Milky Way. He also discovered that the degree of "Doppler shift" (specifically "redshift") observed in the light spectra from other galaxies increased in proportion to a particular galaxy's distance from Earth. This relationship became known as Hubble's law, and helped establish that the known universe is expanding.

Hubble is often incorrectly credited with discovering the Doppler shift in the spectra of galaxies, but this phenomenon had been observed by other astronomers in the 1910s, including Vesto Slipher at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had reported observing blueshift as well as redshift in the spectra of spiral galaxies, indicating motion of their arms both toward and away from Earth respectively, and thus the rotation of such galaxies. Measurements of the redshifts of galaxies and analysis of their significance had also been conducted by James Keeler at the Lick and Allegheny observatories, and William Campbell at the Lick Observatory.

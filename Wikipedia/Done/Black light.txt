Black light

A black light, also referred to as a UV light (Ultra Violet Light), is a lamp that emits electromagnetic radiation almost exclusively in the soft near ultraviolet range that is only partially visible. Black light sources may be made from specially designed fluorescent lamps, mercury vapor lamps, light-emitting diodes, or incandescent lamps. Most of these light-emitting devices are placed within a lamp enclosure designed to reduce the emission of visible light and pass desired parts of the ultraviolet spectrum. In medicine, forensics, and some other scientific fields, such a light source is referred to as a Wood's lamp (named for Robert Williams Wood).

The place on the edge of the visible spectrum gives black light its notable characteristics. It is mainly seen by humans using the low-light receptors in the eye, because the low-light receptors are the most sensitive to near ultra-violet. The low-light receptors however also have the distinctive feature that they are more accurate in the peripheral vision, this means black light always will look out of focus when looked at directly.

Black light sources have many uses. They may be employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, for diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine, for the eradication of microorganisms, for the observation or detection of substances tagged with other substances that exhibit a fluorescent effect, for the curing of plastic resins and for attracting insects. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds. Black light lamps are used for the detection of counterfeit money. Most artificial ultraviolet sources are low power. Powerful ultraviolet sources present a hazard to eyes and skin; apparatus using these sources requires personal protective equipment.

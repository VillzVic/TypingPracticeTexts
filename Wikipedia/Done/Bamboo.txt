Bamboo

Bamboo are a group of perennial evergreen (except for certain temperate species) plants in the true grass family Poaceae, subfamily Bambusoideae, tribe Bambuseae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family.

In bamboo, wheat and other grasses, the internodal regions of the plant stem are hollow, but the vascular bundles, as seen in cross section, are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. Also, the dicotyledonous woody xylem is absent. The absence of secondary growth, wood, causes the stems of monocots, even of palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.

Bamboos are also the fastest growing woody plants in the world. They are capable of growing up to 60 centimeters (24 in.) or more per day due to a unique rhizome-dependent system. However, this astounding growth rate is highly dependent on local soil and climatic conditions. Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in East Asia and South East Asia where they are used extensively in everyday life as building materials, as a food source and as a highly versatile raw product.

There are more than 70 genera divided into about 1,500 species. They are found in diverse climates, from cold mountains to hot tropical regions. They occur across East Asia, from 50 degree N latitude in Sakhalin through to Northern Australia, and west to India and the Himalayas. They also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and in the Americas from the Mid-Atlantic United States south to Argentina and Chile, reaching their southernmost point anywhere, at 47 degree S latitude. Continental Europe is not known to have any native species of bamboo.

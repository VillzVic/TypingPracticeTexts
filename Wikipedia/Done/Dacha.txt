Dacha

Dacha is a Russian word for seasonal or year-round second homes often located in the exurbs of Soviet and post-Soviet cities. Cottages or shacks serving as family's main or only home (or districts of such buildings) are not considered dachas, although many purpose-built dachas are recently being converted for year-round residence. In some cases, dacha are occupied for part of the year by their owners and rented out to urban residents as summer retreats.

Dachas are very common in Russia, and are also widespread in most parts of the former Soviet Union. It is estimated that about 25% of Russian families living in large cities have dachas.

As the size and type of dacha buildings was severely restricted during the Soviet time, some permitted features, such as attics and glazed verandas, became extremely widespread and often oversized. During the 1963-1985 period, these limitations were especially strict: only single-story summer houses without permanent heating and with living areas less than 25 m2 were allowed as second housing (though older dachas that didn't meet these requirements continued to exist). Since 1990, all such limitations have been eliminated.

Anyone who permanently dwells in a dacha is colloquially called a dachnik; the term usually refers to a whole distinctive lifestyle.

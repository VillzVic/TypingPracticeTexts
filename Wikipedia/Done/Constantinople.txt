Constantinople

Constantinople (Greek: Konstantinoupolis, or 'he Polis', Latin: Constantinopolis, in formal Ottoman Turkish: Kostantiniyye) was the imperial capital (Gr: Basileuousa) of the Roman Empire (330-395), the Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire (395-1204 and 1261-1453), the Latin Empire (1204-1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453-1922). Strategically located between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara at the point where Europe meets Asia, Byzantine Constantinople had been the capital of a Christian empire, successor to ancient Greece and Rome. Throughout most of the Middle Ages, Constantinople was Europe's largest and wealthiest city.

Depending on the background of its rulers, it often had several different names at any given time; among the most common were Byzantium (Gr.: Byzantion), New Rome (Gr.: Nea Rhome, Latin: Nova Roma), Constantinople, and Stambol/Stamboul. It was also called Tsargrad ("City of the Emperors") by the Slavs, while to the Vikings it was known as Miklagaro, "the Great City", similar to the common Greek appellation "the City" (he Polis).

It was officially renamed to its modern Turkish name Istanbul in 1930 with the Turkish Postal Service Law, as part of Atatark's national reforms. This name in turn derives from the Greek and Slavic colloquial name Stambol, which is a short form of the name Kon-STAN-tinou-POL-is. Folk etymology, misguided by the prefix I, erroneously derives the name Istanbul from the Greek phrase 'eis ten polin' ("to the City [Constantinople]"). However, the prefix I is simply an addition arising from the properties of the Turkish language, just like the Turkish name Izmir arises from Greek Smyr-ne (see also vowel harmony).

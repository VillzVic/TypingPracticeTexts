Cultigen

A cultigen (from the Latin cultus - cultivated, and gens - kind) is a plant that has been deliberately altered or selected by humans; it is the result of artificial selection. These "man-made" or anthropogenic plants are, for the most part, plants of commerce that are used in horticulture, agriculture and forestry. Because cultigens are defined by their mode of origin and not by where they are growing, plants meeting this definition remain cultigens whether they are naturalised in the wild, deliberately planted in the wild, or growing in cultivation.

Cultigens arise in the following ways: selections of variants from the wild or cultivation including vegetative sports (aberrant growth that can be reproduced reliably in cultivation); plants that are the result of plant breeding and selection programs; genetically modified plants (plants modified by the deliberate implantation of genetic material); and graft-chimaeras (plants grafted to produce mixed tissue, the graft material possibly from wild plants, special selections, or hybrids).

The study of cultigen nomenclature and classification forms the basis of cultivated plant taxonomy. Cultigens are scientifically named according to the principles, rules and recommendations laid down in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (generally referred to as the Cultivated Plant Code). The Cultivated Plant Code provides for the names of cultigens in three classification categories, the cultivar, the Group (formerly Cultivar-group), and the grex; it does not recognize the use of trade designations and other marketing devices as scientifically acceptable names.

Some cultigens have not been given cultivar names and these include: unnamed plants that are the result of breeding, selection, and tissue grafting; ancient cultigens - plants with binomials (i.e. recognized at the level of species) that occur in the wild but which have undergone selection and distribution by humans for so long that their original ancestral distributions and forms in the wild are uncertain or unknown - for example many ancient cultigens, like maize (Zea mays) and banana (Musa spp.), are precursors of important economic crops; and (presumed) anthropogenic plants that are no longer known in the wild and have not been given cultivar or Group names.

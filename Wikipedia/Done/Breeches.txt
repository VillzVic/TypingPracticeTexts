Breeches

Breeches are an item of male clothing covering the body from the waist down, with separate coverings for each leg, usually stopping just below the knee, though in some cases reaching to the ankles.The breeches were normally closed and fastened about the leg, along its open seams at varied lengths, and to the knee, by either buttons or by a draw-string, or by one or more straps and buckle or brooches. Formerly the breeching of a young boy, at an age somewhere between six and eight, was a landmark in his childhood.

The spelling britches reflects a common pronunciation, and is often used in casual speech to mean trousers or "pants". Breeks is a Scots or northern English spelling and pronunciation.

From the 1890s to the 1930s a form of Breeches called Knickers were in fashion with both men and boys. Like their 18th century predecessor, they reached and were fastened just below the knees but the thighs were more loosely worn. There were various versions including Plus-fours for golf wear which reached down a further four inches below the knees.

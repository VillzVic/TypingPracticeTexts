Lee Strasberg joined later and took the helm in 1951 until his death on February 17, 1982. The Studio is best known for its work refining and teaching method acting. This approach was originally developed by the Group Theatre in the 1930s based on the innovations of Constantin Stanislavski. While at the Studio, actors work together to develop their skills in a private environment, where they can take risks as performers without the pressure of commercial roles.

The group initially met in a rehearsal space in the Princess Theatre  In 1955 it moved to its current location in the former Seventh Associate Presbyterian Church, built in 1859.

In 1965 the Actors' Studio opened its west coast branch in West Hollywood, California. The Actors' Studio West is run by artistic co-directors Mark Rydell and Martin Landau and is the only official branch of the Actors' Studio in the world.

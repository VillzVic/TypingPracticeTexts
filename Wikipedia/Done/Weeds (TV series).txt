Weeds (TV series)

Weeds is an American television comedy created by Jenji Kohan and produced by Tilted Productions in association with Lionsgate Television. The central character is Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a widowed mother of two boys who begins selling marijuana to support her family after her husband dies suddenly of a heart attack. Over the course of the show, she and her family become more entangled in illegal activities.

The primary locale of the first three seasons is in the fictional town of Agrestic, California. During seasons four and five, the Botwins reside in the fictional beachside town of Ren Mar, California. During the sixth season, the family relocates to Seattle, Washington before moving to Dearborn, Michigan. In between seasons six and seven, Nancy serves a prison sentence in Danbury prison in Connecticut while her sons and brother-in-law live in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the beginning of season seven, Nancy moves into a recovery house in New York City where she reunites with her family.

Kohan, whose credits include Tracey Takes On..., Mad About You, Sex and the City and Gilmore Girls, is the executive producer of the series alongside Roberto Benabib, of Little City fame. Matthew Salsberg and Craig Zisk have joined the production team as executive producers in later seasons.

The show debuted on the Showtime cable network on August 7, 2005, earning the channel's highest ratings, and the debut of the fifth season had 1.3 million viewers. In 2010, TV Guide Network bought the airing rights, providing audiences free of charge. The show has received numerous awards, including two Satellite Awards, one Golden Globe Award, Writers Guild of America Award, Young Artist Award, and an Emmy Award.

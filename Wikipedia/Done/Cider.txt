Cider

Cider is a fermented beverage made from apple juice. In the United States and Canada the drink has been specified at least since the 1840s as hard cider; the unmodified term "cider" is generally assumed to refer to apple juice. Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% ABV in French cidre doux to 8.5% ABV or more in traditional English ciders.

Although cider can be made from any variety of apple, certain cultivars are preferred in some regions, and these may be known as cider apples. Cider is popular in the United Kingdom, especially in South West England. The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world, including H.P. Bulmer, the largest. As of 2006, the UK produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons).

The beverage is also popular and traditional in Ireland; in Brittany (chistr) and Normandy (cidre) in France; in Asturias and Galicia (Spain) (sidra); in the Rheinland-Pfalz, Hessen (Frankfurt am Main) and other regions of Germany (Most, Viez or Apfelwein); and in the Basque country (sagardoa) of Spain and France. Argentina is a cider-producing and -drinking country, especially the provinces of Rio Negro and Mendoza.

Pear cider is becoming an increasingly popular term and is seen as an alternative name for perry. Its increased use is driven by drinks manufacturers, in order to make it more accessible and understandable to the younger generation who have been attracted to the category in recent years.

On Sunday, May 2, 2010, the Boards of Directors at Continental Airlines and United Airlines approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world's largest airline in revenue passenger miles. The new airline will take on the United Airlines name, Continental's logo and be based out of United's hometown of Chicago. The new United will be run by Continental's CEO, Jeffery Smisek, along with United Airline's CEO, Glenn Tilton, serving as non-executive Chairman of the board. The deal will still need final approval from antitrust regulators and shareholders before being allowed to go forward. United's pilots union announced that they "are fully prepared to protect and defend the interests of all United pilots." The companies expect to complete the transaction, worth (USD)$3.2 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2010.

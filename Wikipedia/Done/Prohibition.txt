Prohibition

Prohibition of alcohol, often referred to simply as prohibition, is a sumptuary law which prohibits alcohol. Typically, the manufacture, transportation, import, export, and sale of alcoholic beverages is restricted or illegal. The term can also apply to the periods in the histories of the countries during which the prohibition of alcohol was enforced. Use of the term as applicable to a historical period is typically applied to countries of European culture. In some countries of the Muslim world, consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden according to Islamic Law - though the strictness by which this prohibition was and is enforced varies considerably between various Islamic countries and various periods in their history. In the early twentieth century, much of the impetus for the prohibition movement in the Nordic countries and North America came from Protestant wariness of alcohol.

The first half of the 20th century saw periods of prohibition of alcoholic beverages in several countries:

 * 1907 to 1948 in Prince Edward Island, but for much shorter periods in other provinces in Canada
 * 1914 to 1925 in Russia and the Soviet Union
 * 1915 to 1922 in Iceland (though beer was still prohibited until 1989)
 * 1916 to 1927 in Norway (fortified wine and beer also prohibited from 1917 to 1923)
 * 1919 in Hungary (in the Hungarian Soviet Republic, March 21 to August 1; called szesztilalom)
 * 1919 to 1932 in Finland (called kieltolaki)
 * 1920 to 1933 in the United States

After several years, prohibition became a failure in North America and elsewhere, as bootlegging (rum-running) became widespread and organized crime took control of the distribution of alcohol. Distilleries and breweries in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or illegally imported to the U.S. Chicago became notorious as a haven for prohibition dodgers during the time known as the Roaring Twenties. Prohibition generally came to an end in the late 1920s or early 1930s in most of North America and Europe, although a few locations continued prohibition for many more years.

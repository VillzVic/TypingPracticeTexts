Minarchism

In civics, minarchism (sometimes called minimal statism, small government, or limited-government libertarianism) refers to a political ideology which maintains that the state's only legitimate function is the protection of individuals from aggression. Minarchists defend the existence of the state as a necessary evil, but assert that it may only act to protect the life, liberty, and property of each individual.

A minarchist state would therefore consist of very few branches/parts of government, in the most minimal way - such as, for an example, courts (but not necessarily). Generally, minarchists identify themselves within the broader propertarian libertarian movement.

Samuel Edward Konkin III, an agorist, coined the term in 1971 to describe libertarians who defend some form of compulsory government. Konkin invented the term minarchism because he initially felt dismayed of using the cumbersome phrase limited-government libertarianism. Some classical liberals, who believe in the necessity of the state, label themselves as minarchists to differentiate from market anarchists.

Contrastingly, market anarchists--who dismiss the legitimacy of all forms of compulsory government and advocate private law, private arbitration, and private defense--see the minimal state as an unnecessary evil on the grounds that it infringes on individual liberty by unnecessary taxation, wars, and police brutality.

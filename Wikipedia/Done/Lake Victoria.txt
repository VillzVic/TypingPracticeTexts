Lake Victoria

Lake Victoria or Victoria Nyanza (also known as Ukerewe and Nalubaale) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria, by John Hanning Speke, the first European to see the lake.

At 68,800 square kilometres (26,600 sq mi), Lake Victoria is Africa's largest lake, and the largest tropical lake in the world. As Lake Michigan-Huron is connected at the same elevation pool and is thus treated as one lake by hydrologists and geographers, Lake Victoria is the world's third-largest freshwater lake. In terms of volume, it is the world's seventh-largest freshwater lake, containing 2,750 cubic kilometres (2.2 billion acre-feet) of water.

The lake receives most of its water from direct precipitation. Its largest influent is the Kagera River, the mouth of which lies on the lake's western shore. The only river to leave the lake, the White Nile (known as the "Victoria Nile" as it leaves the lake), leaves at Jinja, Uganda, on the lake's north shore .

Lake Victoria occupies a shallow depression in the East African Plateau, and has a maxiumum depth of 84 metres (280 ft) and an average depth of 20 metres (66 ft). Its catchment area covers 184,000 square kilometres (71,040 mi2). The lake has a shoreline of some 4,828 kilometres (3,000 mi), with islands constituting some 3.7% of this length, and is divided between three countries: Kenya (6% or 4,100 km2), Uganda (45% or 31,000 km2) and Tanzania (49% or 33,700 km2).

Lake Victoria supports Africa's largest inland fishery.

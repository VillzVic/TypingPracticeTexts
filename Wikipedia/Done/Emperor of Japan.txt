Emperor of Japan

The Emperor (tenno, literally "heavenly sovereign," also referred to as the Mikado) of Japan is the Japanese head of state. He is the head of the Japanese Imperial Family. He is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion. Under Japan's present constitution, the Emperor is the "symbol of the state and the unity of the people," and is a ceremonial figurehead in a constitutional monarchy. This is similar to the British monarch being both the Head of State and the Head of the Anglican Church, in that the Japanese Emperor is both the Head of the Shinto religion and the Head of the State of Japan.

The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. In Nihon Shoki, a book of Japanese history finished in the 8th century, it is said that the Empire of Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu. The current emperor is His Imperial Majesty the Emperor Akihito, who has been on the Chrysanthemum Throne since his father Emperor Showa died in 1989.

The role of the emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial and symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler. Contrary to Western monarchs, the role had rarely been assumed on the field since the establishment of the first shogunate. Japanese emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces, to varying degrees.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the Imperial Palace has been called "Kyujo", then Kokyo, and located on the former site of Edo Castle in the heart of Tokyo. Earlier emperors resided in Kyoto for nearly eleven centuries.

The Emperor's Birthday (currently celebrated on 23 December) is a national holiday.

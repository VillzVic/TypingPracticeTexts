Palais Garnier

The Palais Garnier, also known as the Opera de Paris or Opera Garnier, but more commonly as the Paris Opera, is a 2,200-seat opera house on the Place de l'Opera in Paris, France. A grand landmark designed by Charles Garnier in the Neo-Baroque style, it is regarded as one of the architectural masterpieces of its time.

The building is located in the 9th arrondissement of Paris and is served by the metro station Opera and bus 21, 22, 27, 29, 42, 53, 66, 68, 81, 95.

Upon its inauguration in 1875, the opera house was officially named the Academie Nationale de Musique - Theatre de l'Opera. It retained this title until 1978 when it was re-named the Theatre National de l'Opera de Paris. After the opera company chose the Opera Bastille as their principal theatre upon its completion in 1989, the theatre was re-named as the Palais Garnier, though its more official name, the Academie Nationale de Musique, is still sprawled above the columns of its front facade. In spite of the change of names and the Opera company's relocation to the Opera Bastille, the Palais Garnier is still known by many people as the Paris Opera, as have all of the many theatres which have served as the principal venues of the Parisian Opera and Ballet since its founding.

Taiga

Taiga (from Turkic or Mongolian), also known as the boreal forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests. Covering most of inland Canada, Alaska, Sweden, Finland, inland Norway, some parts of the Scottish Highlands and Russia (especially Siberia), as well as parts of the extreme northern continental United States (northern Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, northern Wisconsin, Upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine), northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (Hokkaido), the taiga is the world's largest terrestrial biome.

The term boreal forest is sometimes, particularly in Canada, used to refer to the more southerly part of the biome, while the term taiga then often is used to describe only the more barren areas of the northernmost part of the taiga approaching the tree line.

Since North America and Asia used to be connected by the Bering land bridge, a number of animal and plant species (more animals than plants) were able to colonize both continents and are distributed throughout the taiga biome. Others differ regionally, typically with each genus having several distinct species, each occupying different regions of the taiga. Taigas also have some small-leaved deciduous trees like birch, alder, willow, and aspen; mostly in areas escaping the most extreme winter cold. However, the Dahurian Larch tolerates the coldest winters on the northern hemisphere in eastern Siberia. The very southernmost parts of the taiga might also have trees like oak, maple, elm and tilia scattered among the conifers.

MythBusters

MythBusters is a science entertainment TV program created and produced by Beyond Television Productions for the Discovery Channel. The series is screened by numerous international broadcasters, including Discovery Channel Australia, Discovery Channel Latin America, Discovery Channel Canada, Quest and the Discovery Channel in the UK. The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos and news stories.

Filming is based in the city of San Francisco, California, though some elements of production are done in Artarmon, Australia. Planning and some experimentation takes place at Hyneman's workshops in the city of San Francisco; experiments requiring more space or special accommodations are filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay Area and other Northern California places, but the show will go to even further locations when required, such as Florida to do some alligator experiments or Africa for some shark and elephant myths.

During the second season, members of Savage and Hyneman's team ("The Build Team") were organized into a second team and now generally test myths separately from the main duo and operate from another workshop.

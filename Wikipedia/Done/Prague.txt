Prague

Prague (Czech: Praha) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. Nicknames for Prague have included Praga mater urbium/Praha matka mest ("Prague - Mother of Cities") in Latin/Czech, Stovezata Praha ("City of a Hundred Spires") in Czech or Zlate mesto/Goldene Stadt ("Golden City") in Czech/German.

Situated on the Vltava River in central Bohemia, Prague has been the political, cultural and economic centre of the Czech state for more than 1100 years. For many decades during the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was the permanent seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus was also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire.

Today, the city proper is home to more than 1.2 million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of over 1.9 million.

Since 1992, the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, making the city one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.1 million international visitors annually, as of 2009.

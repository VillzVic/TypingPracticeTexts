Szekely

The Szekely or Szekler people (Hungarian: Szekely, Romanian: Secui, German: Szekler, Latin: Siculi) are an ethnic subgroup of the Hungarian nation. Their origin has been much debated, it is, however, now generally accepted that they are either Hungarians, or the descendants of a Magyarized Turkic peoples, transplanted there to guard the frontier, their name meaning simply "frontier guards". Their organization was of the Turkic type, and they are probably of Turkic (possibly Avar) stock. By the 11th century they had adopted the Hungarian language.

Along with the Saxons, the Szekely played a key role in the defense of the Medieval Kingdom of Hungary against the Turks  in their role as guards of the eastern border. Today they live mostly in Szekely Land of Transylvania, which roughly correponds to the current counties of Harghita, Covasna and Mures in Romania, with a significant population also living in Tolna, Hungary. Based on official 2002 Romanian census numbers, approximately 1,434,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Romania, mostly in Transylvania. Of these, about 665,000 live in the counties of Harghita, Covasna and parts of Mures, with a Szekely majority (65%). The Szekely therefore account for a significant part (45%) of the Hungarian minority in Romania. When given the choice on the Romanian census between ethnically identifying as "Szekely" or "Hungarian," the overwhelming majority of Szekely choose the latter. Note that they were not allowed to choose both of them. On the last Romanian census (2002), only 150 persons declared their ethnicity as "Szekely".

With the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, Transylvania (including Szekely Land) became part of Romania, and the Szekely population was a target of Romanianization efforts. In post-Cold War Romania, where the Szekely form roughly a third of the ethnic Hungarian population, members of the group have been among the most vocal of Hungarians seeking an autonomous Hungarian region in Transylvania.

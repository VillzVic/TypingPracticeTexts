Chicago Outfit

The Chicago Outfit, also known as The Outfit, Chicago Syndicate and Chicago Mob, is a crime syndicate based in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Dating back to the 1910s, it is part of the American Mafia; however, the Chicago Outfit is distinct from the "Five Families" of New York City, though all Italian-American crime families are ruled by The Commission.

The Outfit in the city of Chicago has no true monopoly on traditional organized crime. It competes for turf, for business, with many other organizations, including the current 'Russian Mafia' and the Jamaican 'posses', among others. The Outfit's control reportedly reaches throughout the western United States to places as far away as Los Angeles, California and parts of Florida. The Chicago Outfit is also known to have large control over neighboring states including Iowa, Wisconsin and other areas of the Midwest. They also have satellite families, or crime families that answer to or are under Outfit control. These include: the Iowa family, the Las Vegas family, the Los Angeles family, the Nebraska family, and the San Diego family.

Unlike the "Five Families," of New York City and other Mafia groups, the Outfit has had other ethnic groups besides Italian Americans in its upper echelons since its earliest days. A prime example of this was Jake Guzik ("Greasy Thumb") who was the top "bagman" and "accountant" for decades until his death. He was Jewish and either Polish or Russian depending on the source. Another mobster was Japanese-American Ken Eto. More prominently was Murray Humphreys, who was of Welsh descent. To this day, the Outfit bears the influence of its best-known leader, Al Capone. In fact for decades after Capone had left the scene, the Outfit was known as "the Capone Gang" or "the Capones" to outsiders. The Outfit's membership is moderately estimated to be between 250-300 "made" members comprising a core group with more than 1,000 associates estimated.

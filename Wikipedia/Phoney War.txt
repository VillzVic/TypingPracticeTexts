Phoney War

The Phony War was a phase early in World War II--in the months following Britain's declaration of war on Germany (shortly after the German invasion of Poland) in September 1939 and preceding the Battle of France in May 1940--that was marked by a lack of major military operations in Continental Europe. The various European powers had declared war on one another but neither side had committed to launching a significant attack, and there was relatively little fighting on the ground, not withstanding the terms of the Anglo-Polish military alliance and the Franco-Polish military alliance, which obliged the United Kingdom and France to assist Poland.

The period was also called at the time, the Twilight War by Winston Churchill, der Sitzkrieg in German ("the sitting war": a play on the word Blitzkrieg), the Bore War (a play on the Boer War), the Polish dziwna wojna ("strange war"), and the French drole de guerre ("strange/phoney war").

The term was possibly coined by Senator William Borah who stated in September 1939, "There is something phony about this war."

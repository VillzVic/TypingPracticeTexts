Dough

Dough is a paste made out of any cereals (grains) or leguminous crops by mixing flour with a small amount of water and/or other liquid. This process is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items (e.g., dumplings), including flatbreads, and pancakes, noodles, crusts, pastry, and similar items. This includes all kinds of breads or similar recipes made from wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, and other cereals or related crops used around the world.

In many parts of central India, people use the quick method of making an instant roasted dough ball or baati. In countries in the Sahel region of Africa, ground and boiled dough balls (made from sorghum or millet) are called aiysh or biya, but are not roasted. Flatbreads such as roti, naan, lavash, sangak, yufka, matzo or matzah, lafa, and tortilla are used in many parts of the world. Some flatbreads, such as naan and roti use leavening agents, others such as matzo are not leavened.

Leavened or fermented dough, made from dry ground grain cereals or legumes mixed with water and yeast are in use all over the world. Salt, sugar and eggs are also common ingredients in dough.

Fried dough foods are also common in many cultures.

Monaco

Monaco, officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principaute de Monaco; Monegasque: Principatu de Munegu; Italian: Principato di Monaco; Occitan: Principat de Monegue), is a sovereign city state on the French Riviera. It is bordered on three sides by its neighbour, France, and its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy. Its area is 1.98 km^2 (0.76 sq mi) with a population of 35,986 as of 2011 and is the most densely populated country in the world. Monaco boasts the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at $151,630 and has the highest HDI (Human Development Index) at 0.946. Monaco also has the world's highest life expectancy at almost 90 years (CIA estimate, 2011), and the lowest Unemployment rate at 0%. With about 40,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day. After a recent expansion of Port Hercule Monaco's total area is 2.05 km^2 (0.79 sq mi), with new plans to extend the district of Fontvieille, with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea.

Monaco is a principality governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state. The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297. The state's sovereignty was officially recognized by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. Despite Monaco being independent and pursuing its own foreign policy course, its national defence is the responsibility of France.

Citizens of Monaco are called Monacans, while Monegasque is the proper term for describing someone who was born in Monaco.

CLIO, n. One of the nine Muses. Clio's function was to preside over history--which she did with great dignity, many of the prominent citizens of Athens occupying seats on the platform, the meetings being addressed by Messrs. Xenophon, Herodotus and other popular speakers.

CLOCK, n. A machine of great moral value to man, allaying his concern for the future by reminding him what a lot of time remains to him.

  A busy man complained one day:
  "I get no time!"  "What's that you say?"
  Cried out his friend, a lazy quiz;
  "You have, sir, all the time there is.
  There's plenty, too, and don't you doubt it--
  We're never for an hour without it."

CLOSE-FISTED, adj. Unduly desirous of keeping that which many meritorious persons wish to obtain.

  "Close-fisted Scotchman!" Johnson cried
      To thrifty J. Macpherson;
  "See me--I'm ready to divide
      With any worthy person."
  Sad Jamie:  "That is very true--
      The boast requires no backing;
  And all are worthy, sir, to you,
      Who have what you are lacking."

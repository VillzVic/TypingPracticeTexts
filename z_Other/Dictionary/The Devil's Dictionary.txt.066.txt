  But that beast did ensue and the hunter it threw
      O'er the top of a palm that adjacent grew;

GORGON, n.

  The Gorgon was a maiden bold
  Who turned to stone the Greeks of old

  And swear that workmanship so bad
  Proves all the ancient sculptors mad.

GOUT, n. A physician's name for the rheumatism of a rich patient.

GRACES, n. Three beautiful goddesses, Aglaia, Thalia and Euphrosyne, who attended upon Venus, serving without salary. They were at no expense for board and clothing, for they ate nothing to speak of and dressed according to the weather, wearing whatever breeze happened to be blowing.

GRAMMAR, n. A system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet for the self-made man, along the path by which he advances to distinction.

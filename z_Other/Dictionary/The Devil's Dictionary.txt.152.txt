  "Unhappy soul! for that alone you squirm
  O'er fire unquenched, a never-dying worm.

  "Yet, for I pity your uneasy state,
  Your doom I'll mollify and pains abate.

  "Naught, for a season, shall your comfort mar,
  Not even the memory of who you are."

  Throughout eternal space dread silence fell;
  Heaven trembled as Compassion entered Hell.

  "As long, sweet demon, let my respite be
  As, governing down here, I'd respite thee."

  "As long, poor soul, as any of the pack
  You thrust from jail consumed in getting back."

  A genial chill affected Altgeld's hide
  While they were turning him on t'other side.

RESPLENDENT, adj. Like a simple American citizen beduking himself in his lodge, or affirming his consequence in the Scheme of Things as an elemental unit of a parade.

      The Knights of Dominion were so resplendent in their velvet- and-gold that their masters would hardly have known them.

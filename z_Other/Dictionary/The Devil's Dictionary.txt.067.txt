  My humbler service pray accept--
      I'll help to kill the scoffer.
  The water-drinkers and the cranks
      Who load their skins with liquor--
  I'll gladly bear their belly-tanks
      And tap them with my sticker.

  Fill up, fill up, for wisdom cools
      When e'er we let the wine rest.
  Here's death to Prohibition's fools,
      And every kind of vine-pest!

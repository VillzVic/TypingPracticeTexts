SCARABAEUS, n. The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians, allied to our familiar "tumble-bug." It was supposed to symbolize immortality, the fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity. Its habit of incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it to the favor of the priesthood, and may some day assure it an equal reverence among ourselves. True, the American beetle is an inferior beetle, but the American priest is an inferior priest.

SCARABEE, n. The same as scarabaeus.

              He fell by his own hand
                  Beneath the great oak tree.
              He'd traveled in a foreign land.
              He tried to make her understand
              The dance that's called the Saraband,
                  But he called it Scarabee.
  He had called it so through an afternoon,
      And she, the light of his harem if so might be,
      Had smiled and said naught. O the body was fair to see,
  All frosted there in the shine o' the moon--
                      Dead for a Scarabee
  And a recollection that came too late.
                          O Fate!
                  They buried him where he lay,
                  He sleeps awaiting the Day,
                          In state,
  And two Possible Puns, moon-eyed and wan,
  Gloom over the grave and then move on.
                      Dead for a Scarabee!

  So scornful of the law should be--
  An anar c, h, i, s, t."

  (That is the way that they preferred
  To utter the abhorrent word,
  So strong the aversion that it stirred.)

  "Resolved," they said, continuing,
  "That Badman John must cease this thing
  Of having his unlawful fling.

  "Now, by these sacred relics"--here
  Each man had out a souvenir
  Got at a lynching yesteryear--

  "By these we swear he shall forsake
  His ways, nor cause our hearts to ache
  By sins of rope and torch and stake.

  "We'll tie his red right hand until
  He'll have small freedom to fulfil
  The mandates of his lawless will."

  So, in convention then and there,
  They named him Sheriff. The affair
  Was opened, it is said, with prayer.

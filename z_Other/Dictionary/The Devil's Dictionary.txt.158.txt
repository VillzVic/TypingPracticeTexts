      By guard unparried as by flight unstayed,
  O serviceable Rumor, let me wield
      Against my enemy no other blade.
  His be the terror of a foe unseen,
      His the inutile hand upon the hilt,
  And mine the deadly tongue, long, slender, keen,
      Hinting a rumor of some ancient guilt.
  So shall I slay the wretch without a blow,
  Spare me to celebrate his overthrow,
  And nurse my valor for another foe.

S



SABBATH, n. A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh. Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version: "Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly." To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views. So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment:

  Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,
  And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable.

Decks are no longer holystoned, but the cable still supplies the captain with opportunity to attest a pious respect for the divine ordinance.

PRESENT, n. That part of eternity dividing the domain of disappointment from the realm of hope.

PRESENTABLE, adj. Hideously appareled after the manner of the time and place.

In Boorioboola-Gha a man is presentable on occasions of ceremony if he have his abdomen painted a bright blue and wear a cow's tail; in New York he may, if it please him, omit the paint, but after sunset he must wear two tails made of the wool of a sheep and dyed black.

PRESIDE, v. To guide the action of a deliberative body to a desirable result. In Journalese, to perform upon a musical instrument; as, "He presided at the piccolo."

  The Headliner, holding the copy in hand,

  "The music was very uncommonly grand--

          For our townsman Brown presided
      At the organ with skill and grace."
  The Headliner discontinued to read,

  On the desk, he dashed in at the top of the screed:
      "Great playing by President Brown."

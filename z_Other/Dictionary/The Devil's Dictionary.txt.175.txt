  He too is reeking rich--deducting _you_.

SYLLOGISM, n. A logical formula consisting of a major and a minor assumption and an inconsequent. (See LOGIC.)

SYLPH, n. An immaterial but visible being that inhabited the air when the air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory smoke, sewer gas and similar products of civilization. Sylphs were allied to gnomes, nymphs and salamanders, which dwelt, respectively, in earth, water and fire, all now insalubrious. Sylphs, like fowls of the air, were male and female, to no purpose, apparently, for if they had progeny they must have nested in accessible places, none of the chicks having ever been seen.

SYMBOL, n. Something that is supposed to typify or stand for something else. Many symbols are mere "survivals"--things which having no longer any utility continue to exist because we have inherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on memorial monuments. They were once real urns holding the ashes of the dead. We cannot stop making them, but we can give them a name that conceals our helplessness.

SYMBOLIC, adj. Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols.

  They say 'tis conscience feels compunction;
  I hold that that's the stomach's function,
  For of the sinner I have noted
  That when he's sinned he's somewhat bloated,
  Or ill some other ghastly fashion
  Within that bowel of compassion.
  True, I believe the only sinner
  Is he that eats a shabby dinner.
  You know how Adam with good reason,
  For eating apples out of season,
  Was "cursed." But that is all symbolic:
  The truth is, Adam had the colic.

G.J.
